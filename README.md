### 1. Business Problem

The company lacked a centralized and interactive way to analyze sales performance across multiple years, product categories, and customer segments. Key decision-makers struggled to identify which products and regions were driving profits or where improvements were needed. Manual reporting made it difficult to track trends, understand customer behavior, and make data-driven decisions in real time.
